# email-tracker
Email Tracker allows you to send emails and track those emails to see if they were opened or not. If they were opened, you can see their IP address , user agent, Location, Time of opening etc.

How to:

 1. Set-up a local environment xampp or host in any sever like 000webhost.
 2. View the email.html and copy entire content and paste on email inbox.
 3. When properly set-up each time a person opens the email, his IP-address should be logged on the log.txt file.
